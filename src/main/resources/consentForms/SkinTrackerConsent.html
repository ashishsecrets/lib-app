	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>We are asking you to consider taking part in a research study being done by Dr. Wilson Liao,
		Dr. Tina Bhutani, Dr. Kelly Cordoro, and Dr. Katrina Abuabara in the UCSF Department of Dermatology. The study
		team will explain the details of the study to you and answer any questions that you may have. </p>
	<p>Research studies include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about
		participating. You may discuss your decision with your family and friends and with your health care team. If you
		have any questions, you may ask your study doctor.</p>

	<h3>Purpose of the study</h3>
	<p>Skin diseases can be very challenging to treat because they can fluctuate. A
		patient’s visit with a medical provider only captures a small portion of his or her disease activity. The
		purpose of this study is to create and test a mobile app called SkinTracker in patients with skin diseases such
		as eczema. Subjects in this study will use SkinTracker to enter information about their symptoms and severity
		and report back to the study team.</p>

	<h3>Study Procedures</h3>
	<p>If you choose to be in this study, you will be asked to use SkinTracker for 12 months.
		This app will allow you to record information about your skin condition on a daily to weekly basis. In addition,
		you will be asked to come to UCSF for five in-person visits to have your skin evaluated. While in this study,
		you will continue your routine treatment for your skin condition; this study will not impact the medical care
		that you normally receive and does not involve taking any medication specifically for the study.</p>

	<h3>Possible Risks</h3>
	<p>There are risks to taking part in a research study. Some potential risks of participation in this study include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Loss of privacy in the event of a data breach of information stored by the app. </li>
		<li>Increased awareness of skin activity causing stress or concerns.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Of note, the privacy of your data is protected to the highest extent possible using data encryption using
		strong SSL certificates and compliance with HIPAA.</b></p>

	<h3>Possible Benefits</h3>
	<p>Some potential benefits of your participation in this study include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Having better surveillance of your skin condition.</li>
		<li>Helping to improve research efforts in the future.</li>
		<li>More frequent monitoring of your skin condition by a physician. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Your Other Options</h3>
<p>You do not have to participate in this study. Your other choices may include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Getting treatment or care for your condition without being in a study.</li>
		<li>Taking part in another study.</li>
		<li>Getting no treatment or receiving symptomatic care to relieve your symptoms and discomfort.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is a more detailed description of the study. Please read it carefully. You can ask any questions you want
		to help you decide whether or not to join. If you join the study, we will give you a signed copy of this form
		for future reference.</p>

	<h3>DETAILED STUDY DESCRIPTION</h3>
	<p>You are being asked to take part in this study because you have had a verified skin condition such as atopic
		dermatitis (eczema) for at least 6 months. You will be seen for a total of five study visits and be enrolled for
		12 months. </p>
	<h3>Study location</h3>
	<p>All study procedures will be done at the UCSF Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center located at 515 Spruce Street, San Francisco, CA 94118.</p>
	<h3>How many people will take part in this study?</h3>
	<p>There will be 10 total patients enrolled in this study.</p>

	<h3>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</h3>

	<p>If you decide to take part in this study, you will meet with members of the research team for an initial
		screening appointment (Visit 1 in the chart above). A researcher will make sure that you qualify for the study.
		They will also take your vitals and perform a physical exam to evaluate your skin condition. Finally, the
		researcher will instruct you on how to use the mobile app SkinTracker and explain what information will be
		recorded and how to record this information. You will be given a FitBit Alta HR wrist band, which will record
		health information that will be inputted into SkinTracker. During Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5, you
		will be evaluated again by a member of the research team and also give feedback on how SkinTracker can be
		improved.</p>

	<h3>Before you begin the main part of the study...</h3>

	<p>The research team will speak with you and examine your skin to confirm your skin condition. The researchers will
		also verify that you meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. </p>

	<h3>During the main part of the study...</h3>

	<p>During the main part of the study, you will record data on SkinTracker once each week. In addition, once every 3
		months, you will meet with the study physician. SkinTracker will ask you to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Record itch, dryness, redness, swelling, scabbing, scratch marks, and skin thickening</li>
			<li>Record a voice diary</li>
			<li>Record your medication usage adherence</li>
			<li>Record any adverse events</li>
			<li>Take photos of your arms, trunk, legs, back and neck</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>When you are finished with the study…</h3>
	<p>When you are finished with this study, you may choose to continue to use SkinTracker if you like. If you
		continue to use SkinTracker after 12 months, you will have the option of whether you would like to share your
		data with the study team. In addition, you will receive financial compensation for your participation in the
		study (see payment section for details).</p>

	<h3>How long will I be in the study?</h3>
	<p>You will be asked to use SkinTracker for 12 months. You will input the requested information at least once each
		week. Additionally, you will visit with the research team 5 times.</p>

	<h3>Can I stop being in the study?</h3>
	<p>Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to
		stop. He or she will tell you how to stop your participation safely.</p>
	<p>The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best
		interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped.</p>

	<h3>What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?</h3>
	<p>This study does not involve receiving a study drug or any medical intervention. Any side effects of medications
		that you start while in the study or are taking before starting the study are unlikely to be related to using
		SkinTracker. If you experience side effects during the study, you will need to follow-up with your routine
		medical provider.</p>
	<p>A non-medical risk of participating in this study includes breach of personal information that is stored in
		SkinTracker. The app development company RedBlink Inc. has several safety practices in place to ensure that data
		that you input into the app is secure. However, as with all personal information, there is a potential chance
		for loss of privacy due to a security breach. RedBlink Inc. will not have access to your medical records and
		will only have access to information that you store in SkinTracker.</p>
	<h3>Unknown Risks</h3>
	<p>The experimental mobile app may have risks that no one knows about yet. The
			researchers will let you know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about
			participating in the study.</p>
		<p>For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.</p>

	<h3>Are there benefits to taking part in the study?</h3>
	<p>There is no anticipated direct medical benefit to you from participating in this study. However, this study will
		help doctors learn more about skin conditions and it is hoped that this information will help in the treatment
		of future patients with skin conditions. We also hope that the information in this study will allow patients to
		better track their skin symptoms in the future using mobile technology.</p>

	<h3>What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?</h3>
	<p>Your other choices may include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Getting treatment or care for your eczema without being in this study. </li>
			<li>Taking part in another study.</li>
			<li>Getting no treatment.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Please talk to your doctor about your choices before deciding if you will take part in this study.</p>

	<h3>How will information about me be kept confidential?</h3>
	<p>Participation in research involves some loss of privacy. We will do our best to make sure that information about
		you is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy. Some information from your medical records may
		be collected and used for this study for recruitment and comparing your medical data to SkinTracker data. If you
		do not have a UCSF medical record, one will be created for you. Your signed consent form and some of your
		research tests will be added to your UCSF medical record. Therefore, people involved with your future care and
		insurance may become aware of your participation and of any information added to your medical record as a result
		of your participation. Study tests that are performed by research labs, and information gathered directly from
		you by the researchers will be part of your research records but will not be added to your medical record. Your
		personal information may be given out if required by law. If information from this study is published or
		presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used.</p>
	<p>Authorized representatives from the following organizations may review your research data for the purpose of
	monitoring or managing the conduct of this study:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Study Mobile App Developer: RedBlink Inc.</li>
		<li>Representatives of the University of California</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Neither RedBlink Inc. nor the study Sponsor Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will have access to your medical records.
		As a mobile app development company, RedBlink Inc. may use deidentified data from this study to develop new
		mobile apps in the future.</p>

	<h3>Are there any costs to me for taking part in this study?</h3>
	<p>No. SkinTracker and the FitBit Alta HR wristband will be provided to you at no cost.</p>

	<h3>Will I be paid for taking part in this study?</h3>
	<p>In return for your time, effort and travel expenses, you will be paid $200 for taking part in this study. You
		will be paid $50 per visit for visits 2, 3, 4 and 5. If you decide to leave the study early, you will be paid
		for the visits that you have already completed. If you complete the study, you will be allowed to keep your
		FitBit Alta HR wristband.</p>

	<h3>Who pays for this study?</h3>
	<p>This study will be funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. By funding this study, Regeneron is hoping to improve
		research data collection in dermatology research. This may help both Regeneron and researchers in general better
		collect data for other studies in the future.</p>
