	<h3>What is this study about?</h3>
	<p>Dr. Wilson Liao, Dr. Tina Bhutani, Dr. Kelly Cordoro, and Dr.
		Katrina Abuabara from the UCSF Department of Dermatology are doing a
		research study. This study will use a newly created mobile app called
		SkinTracker in patients with skin diseases.</p>
	<p>The study doctors hope this study will help both young people
		and adults with skin diseases but don’t know if it will for sure.
		Because you have a skin disease, the doctors are asking if you want to
		be in this study.</p>
	<h3>How many people will take part in this study?</h3>
	<p>About 10 people will be in this study. 6 will be adults age 18
		or older. 4 will be children and adolescents (13 to 17 years old). The
		study will take place at the UCSF Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center
		in San Francisco, CA.</p>
	<h3>What will happen if you decide you might want to be in this
		research study?</h3>
	<p>First, your parents will be asked if they give their permission
		for you to be in this study. They will also be asked if they agree to
		participate themselves, by doing some things like answering questions
		about you and helping you finish study tasks. If your parents don’t
		agree, you cannot be in the study. If your parents do agree, and you
		agree too, here’s what will happen next:</p>
	<h3>Before you begin the study</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The study doctor will ask your parents some questions about
			you.</li>
		<li>The study doctor will ask you questions about your health.</li>
		<li>The study doctor will take your vital signs.</li>
		<li>The study doctor will perform a physical exam to look at how
			bad your skin disease is.</li>
		<li>The study doctor will have you or your parents download the
			app SkinTracker and show you how to use it.</li>
		<li>The study doctor will give you a FitBit Alta HR wristband and
			show you how to use it with SkinTracker.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>During the study</h3>
	<p>If you are going to stay in the research study, you will have to
		use SkinTracker in the way that the study doctor explained.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>At least once each week, you will open SkinTracker and answer
			questions that it asks. You or your parents will also take pictures
			of your skin disease on SkinTracker. You will do this at least once
			each week for 12 months.</li>
		<li>You will also have visits with the study physician. During
			these visits, the study physician will examine your skin disease. He
			or she will also ask you how you like SkinTracker and if you have
			suggestions to make it better. Your parents can help answer these
			questions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>When the study ends</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You and your parents will be able to decide if you would like
			to keep using SkinTracker or if you would like to stop. When the study
			ends, you will not have any more study visits.</li>
		<li>You or your parents will receive $200 for your time.</li>
		<li>You will be allowed to keep the FitBit Alta HR wristband if
			you finish the study.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Will any parts of this study hurt or have other risks?</h3>
	<p>There is no part of the study that should hurt – you will not
		receive any medication or injections from this study.</p>
	<h3>Will you get better if you are in this study?</h3>
	<p>We don’t know if this study will make you feel better. You may
		get a little better by being in this study, or you may stay the same,
		or you may get worse. Any medication or treatment that you are getting
		for your skin disease will be decided on by you, your parents, and
		your regular doctor. The study doctors will not change your medication
		for your skin disease or provide you medication for your skin disease.
	</p>
	<h3>What if you have questions?</h3>
	<p>You can ask your study doctor(s) Dr. Liao, Dr. Bhutani, Dr.
		Cordoro, Dr. Abuabara and/or Dr. Thibodeaux, or the people who work
		with them any questions you have about the study. You can ask your
		questions any time you like. You can also ask your parents to ask
		questions for you.</p>
	<h3>What are your choices?</h3>
	<p>If your parents agree, you can be in this study if you want to.
		But you don’t have to be in it if you don’t want to. Nobody will get
		mad at you if you don’t want to do this.</p>
	<p>If you don’t want to be in the study, you can continue the
		medication that you take now. Or if you don’t take any medication
		right now, your doctor may be able to find an available medication
		that works for you. Or you may not want any medication now.</p>
	<p>If you decide to be in the study now and you change your mind
		later, that’s okay, too. You just have to tell the study doctor or the
		study staff as soon as you change your mind, and you will be taken out
		of the study.</p>
	<h3>If you don’t want to be in this study, just say so, and don’t
		sign this form.</h3>
