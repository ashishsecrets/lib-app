<p>This is an observational research study. Your child’s study doctor(s) Dr. Wilson Liao, Dr. Tina Bhutani, Dr. Kelly Cordoro, Dr. Katrina Abuabara, and/or Dr. Quinn Thibodeaux from the UCSF Department of Dermatology will explain the study to you.</p>

<h3>STUDY SUMMARY:</h3>

<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> We are asking you to consider allowing your child to take part in a research study being done by Dr. Wilson Liao, Dr. Tina Bhutani, Dr. Kelly Cordoro, and Dr. Katrina Abuabara in the UCSF Department of Dermatology. The study team will explain the details of the study to you and answer any questions that you may have.</br></br>

Research studies include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your decision with your family and friends and with your health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your study doctor.</br></br>

<b>Purpose of the study:</b> Skin diseases can be very challenging to treat because they can fluctuate. A patient’s visit with a medical provider only captures a small portion of his or her disease activity. The purpose of this study is to create and test a mobile app called SkinTracker in patients with skin diseases such as eczema. Subjects in this study will use SkinTracker to enter information about their symptoms and severity and report back to the study team. As a parent or legal guardian, you will be asked to supervise your child during their participation in this study.</br></br>

<b>Study Procedures:</b> If you choose to allow your child to be in this study, you will be asked to help them use SkinTracker for 12 months. This app will allow your child to record information about their skin condition on a daily to weekly basis. In addition, you will be asked to accompany your child to UCSF for five in-person visits to have their skin evaluated. While in this study, your child should continue their routine treatment for their skin condition; this study will not impact the medical care that your child normally receives and does not involve taking any medication specifically for the study.
</p>

<p>
<b>Possible Risks:</b></br>
There are risks to taking part in a research study. Some potential risks of participation in this study include:
	<ul>
		<li>Loss of privacy in the event of a data breach of information stored by the app.</li>
		<li>Increased awareness of skin activity causing stress or concerns.</li>
	</ul>
<b>Of note, the privacy of your child’s data is protected to the highest extent possible using data encryption using strong SSL certificates and compliance with HIPAA.</b></br></br>

<b>Possible Benefits:</b></br>
Some potential benefits of your child’s participation in this study include:
	<ul>
		<li>Having better surveillance of your child’s skin condition.</li>
		<li>Helping to improve research efforts in the future.</li>
		<li>More frequent monitoring of your child’s skin condition by a physician.</li>
	</ul>
<b>Your Other Options:</b></br> You do not have to participate in this study. Your other choices may include:
	<ul>
		<li>Getting treatment or care for your child’s condition without being in a study.</li>
		<li>Taking part in another study.</li>
		<li>Getting no treatment or receiving symptomatic care to relieve your child’s symptoms and discomfort.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
Below is a more detailed description of the study. Please read it carefully. You can ask any questions you want to help you decide whether or not to join. If your child joins the study, we will give you a signed copy of this form for future reference.
</p>

<h3>DETAILED STUDY DESCRIPTION:</h3>

<p>
You are being asked to take part in this study because your child has had a verified skin condition such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) for at least 6 months. Your child will be seen for a total of five study visits and be enrolled for 12 months.</br></br>
<b>Study location:</b> All study procedures will be done at the UCSF Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center located at 515 Spruce Street, San Francisco, CA 94118.
<h3>How many people will take part in this study?</h3>
There will be 10 total patients enrolled in this study.
</p>

<h3>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</h3>

<p>
If you decide to take part in this study, you and your child will meet with members of the research team for an initial screening appointment (Visit 1 in the chart above). A researcher will make sure that your child qualifies for the study. They will also take your child’s vitals and perform a physical exam to evaluate your child’s skin condition. Finally, the researcher will instruct you and your child on how to use the mobile app SkinTracker and explain what information will be recorded and how to record this information. You will be given a FitBit Alta HR wrist band for your child to use, which will record health information that will be inputted into SkinTracker. During Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5, your child will be evaluated again by a member of the research team and also give feedback on how SkinTracker can be improved. At home, you will supervise your child and assist with using SkinTracker if your child has difficulties with inputting data into the mobile app.</p>

<h3>Before you begin the main part of the study...</h3>

<p>The research team will speak with you and your child and examine your child’s skin to confirm your child’s skin condition. The researchers will also verify that your child meets all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study.</p>

<h3>During the main part of the study...</h3>

<p>During the main part of the study, you and your child will record data on SkinTracker once each week. In addition, once every 3 months, you and your child will meet with the study physician. SkinTracker will ask you and your child to:
	<ol>
		<li>Record itch, dryness, redness, swelling, scabbing, scratch marks, and skin thickening</li>
		<li>Record a voice diary</li>
		<li>Record your medication usage adherence</li>
		<li>Record any adverse events</li>
		<li>Take photos of your arms, trunk, legs, back and neck</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>

<h3>When you are finished with the study…</h3>
When you are finished with this study, you and your child may choose to continue to use SkinTracker if you like. If your child continues to use SkinTracker after 12 months, you and your child will have the option of whether you would like to share your child’s data with the study team. In addition, you and your child will receive financial compensation for your participation in the study (see payment section for details).

<h3>How long will my child be in the study?</h3>
Your child will be asked to use SkinTracker for 12 months. You and your child will input the requested information at least once each week. Additionally, you and your child will visit with the research team 5 times.

<h3>Can my child stop being in the study?</h3>
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you and/or your child are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. He or she will tell you how to stop your participation safely.</br></br>
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your child’s best interest, if you and/or your child do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped.

<h3>What side effects or risks can I expect for my child from being in the study?</h3>
This study does not involve receiving a study drug or any medical intervention. Any side effects of medications that your child starts while in the study or are taking before starting the study are unlikely to be related to using SkinTracker. If your child experience side effects during the study, they will need to follow-up with their routine medical provider.

A non-medical risk of participating in this study includes breach of personal information that is stored in SkinTracker. The app development company RedBlink Inc. has several safety practices in place to ensure that data that you and your child input into the app is secure. However, as with all personal information, there is a potential chance for loss of privacy due to a security breach. RedBlink Inc. will not have access to your medical records and will only have access to information that you store in SkinTracker.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Unknown Risks:</b> The experimental mobile app may have risks that no one knows about yet. The researchers will let you know if they learn 			anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.</li>
		<li>For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Are there benefits to taking part in the study?</h3>

There is no anticipated direct medical benefit to you or your child from participating in this study. However, this study will help doctors learn more about skin conditions and it is hoped that this information will help in the treatment of future patients with skin conditions. We also hope that the information in this study will allow patients to better track their skin symptoms in the future using mobile technology.

<h3>What other choices does my child have if we do not take part in this study?</h3>
Your other choices may include:
	<ul>
		<li>Getting treatment or care for your child’s skin condition without being in this study.</li>
		<li>Taking part in another study.</li> 
		<li>Getting no treatment.</li>
	</ul>
Please talk to your child’s doctor about your choices before deciding if you will take part in this study.

<h3>How will information about my child be kept confidential?</h3>

Participation in research involves some loss of privacy. We will do our best to make sure that information about your child is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy. Some information from your child’s medical records may be collected and used forthis study to help with recruitment and to compare data with SkinTracker. If your child does not have a UCSF medical record, one will be created for them. Your signed consent form, your child’s signed assent form, and some of your child’s research tests will be added to your child’s UCSF medical record. Therefore, people involved with your child’s future care and insurance may become aware of your child’s participation and of any information added to your child’s medical record as a result of your child’s participation. Study tests that are performed by research labs, and information gathered directly from your child by the researchers will be part of your child’s research records but will not be added to your child’s medical record. Your child’s personal information may be given out if required by law. If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your child’s name and other personal information will not be used.</br></br>
Authorized representatives from the following organizations may review your child’s research data for the purpose of monitoring or managing the conduct of this study:
	<ul>
		<li>Study Mobile App Developer: RedBlink Inc.</li>
		<li>Representatives of the University of California</li>
	</ul>
Neither RedBlink Inc. nor the study Sponsor Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will have access to your child’s medical record. As a mobile app development company, RedBlink Inc. may use deidentified data from this study to develop new mobile apps in the future.

<h3>Are there any costs to me for taking part in this study?</h3>
No. SkinTracker and the FitBit Alta HR wristband will be provided to you and your child at no cost.

<h3>Will I be paid for taking part in this study?</h3>
In return for you and your child’s time, effort and travel expenses, you will be paid $200 for taking part in this study. You will be paid $50 per visit for visits 2, 3, 4 and 5. If you decide to leave the study early, you will be paid for the visits that you have already completed. If you and your child complete the study, you will be allowed to keep the FitBit Alta HR wristband provided for the study.
 
<h3>Who pays for this study?</h3>
This study will be funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. By funding this study, Regeneron is hoping to improve research data collection in dermatology research. This may help both Regeneron and researchers in general better collect data for other studies in the future.
