<h3>How will information about me be kept confidential?</h3>

<p>Participation in research involves some loss of privacy.  We will do our best to make sure that information about you is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Some information from your medical records may be collected and used for this study for recruitment and comparing your medical data to SkinTracker data. If you do not have a UCSF medical record, one will be created for you.  Your signed consent form and some of your research tests will be added to your UCSF medical record.  Therefore, people involved with your future care and insurance may become aware of your participation and of any information added to your medical record as a result of your participation.  Study tests that are performed by research labs, and information gathered directly from you by the researchers will be part of your research records but will not be added to your medical record. Your personal information may be given out if required by law. If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used.</br></br>

Authorized representatives from the following organizations may review your research data for the purpose of monitoring or managing the conduct of this study:
	<ul>
		<li>Study Mobile App Developer: RedBlink Inc.</li>
		<li>Representatives of the University of California</li>
	</ul>
Neither RedBlink Inc. nor the study Sponsor Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will have access to your medical records. As a mobile app development company, RedBlink Inc. may use deidentified data from this study to develop new mobile apps in the future.
