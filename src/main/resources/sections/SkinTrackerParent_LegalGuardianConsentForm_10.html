<h3>How will information about my child be kept confidential?</h3>

<p>Participation in research involves some loss of privacy. We will do our best to make sure that information about your child is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy. Some information from your child’s medical records may be collected and used forthis study to help with recruitment and to compare data with SkinTracker. If your child does not have a UCSF medical record, one will be created for them. Your signed consent form, your child’s signed assent form, and some of your child’s research tests will be added to your child’s UCSF medical record. Therefore, people involved with your child’s future care and insurance may become aware of your child’s participation and of any information added to your child’s medical record as a result of your child’s participation. Study tests that are performed by research labs, and information gathered directly from your child by the researchers will be part of your child’s research records but will not be added to your child’s medical record. Your child’s personal information may be given out if required by law. If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your child’s name and other personal information will not be used.</br></br>
Authorized representatives from the following organizations may review your child’s research data for the purpose of monitoring or managing the conduct of this study:
	<ul>
		<li>Study Mobile App Developer: RedBlink Inc.</li>
		<li>Representatives of the University of California</li>
	</ul>
Neither RedBlink Inc. nor the study Sponsor Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will have access to your child’s medical record. As a mobile app development company, RedBlink Inc. may use deidentified data from this study to develop new mobile apps in the future.
