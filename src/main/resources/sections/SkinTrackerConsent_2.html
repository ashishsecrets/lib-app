<h3>STUDY SUMMARY:</h3>

<p>
<b>Introduction:</b> We are asking you to consider taking part in a research study being done by Dr. Wilson Liao, Dr. Tina Bhutani, Dr. Kelly Cordoro, and Dr. Katrina Abuabara in the UCSF Department of Dermatology. The study team will explain the details of the study to you and answer any questions that you may have. </br></br>

Research studies include only people who choose to take part.  Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your decision with your family and friends and with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you may ask your study doctor.</br></br>

<b>Purpose of the study:</b> Skin diseases can be very challenging to treat because they can fluctuate. A patientâ€™s visit with a medical provider only captures a small portion of his or her disease activity. The purpose of this study is to create and test a mobile app called SkinTracker in patients with skin diseases such as eczema. Subjects in this study will use SkinTracker to enter information about their symptoms and severity and report back to the study team.</br></br>

<b>Study Procedures:</b> If you choose to be in this study, you will be asked to use SkinTracker for 12 months. This app will allow you to record information about your skin condition on a daily to weekly basis. In addition, you will be asked to come to UCSF for five in-person visits to have your skin evaluated. While in this study, you will continue your routine treatment for your skin condition; this study will not impact the medical care that you normally receive and does not involve taking any medication specifically for the study.
