<h3>Are there benefits to taking part in the study?</h3>

<p>There is no anticipated direct medical benefit to you or your child from participating in this study. However, this study will help doctors learn more about skin conditions and it is hoped that this information will help in the treatment of future patients with skin conditions. We also hope that the information in this study will allow patients to better track their skin symptoms in the future using mobile technology.</p>

<h3>What other choices does my child have if we do not take part in this study?</h3>
<p>Your other choices may include:
	<ul>
		<li>Getting treatment or care for your child’s skin condition without being in this study.</li>
		<li>Taking part in another study.</li> 
		<li>Getting no treatment.</li>
	</ul>
Please talk to your child’s doctor about your choices before deciding if you will take part in this study.
