<h3>What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?</h3>

Any side effects of medications that you start while in the study or are taking before starting the study are unlikely to be related to using SkinTracker. If you experience side effects during the study, you will need to follow-up with your routine medical provider. 

A non-medical risk of participating in this study includes breach of personal information that is stored in SkinTracker. The app development company RedBlink Inc. has several safety practices in place to ensure that data that you input into the app is secure.
