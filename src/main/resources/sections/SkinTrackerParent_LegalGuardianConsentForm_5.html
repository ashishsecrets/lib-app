<h3>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</h3>

<p>
If you decide to take part in this study, you and your child will meet with members of the research team for an initial screening appointment (Visit 1 in the chart above). A researcher will make sure that your child qualifies for the study. They will also take your child’s vitals and perform a physical exam to evaluate your child’s skin condition. Finally, the researcher will instruct you and your child on how to use the mobile app SkinTracker and explain what information will be recorded and how to record this information. You will be given a FitBit Alta HR wrist band for your child to use, which will record health information that will be inputted into SkinTracker. During Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5, your child will be evaluated again by a member of the research team and also give feedback on how SkinTracker can be improved. At home, you will supervise your child and assist with using SkinTracker if your child has difficulties with inputting data into the mobile app.</p>
